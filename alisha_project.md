<h1>Asians in the Tech Sterotype: Myth or Reality?</h1>
<p>The sterotype is that Asians are good at tech. And that tech industry is full of them. </p>
<p>But is it a just a streotype or is there any truth to it?</p>
<p>Only data will tell!</p>
<p>My aim with this project is to test the stereotype of asians in tech. Althought the model minority myth potrays asians as succesful and perfect, many asians would disagree.</p>
<p>Through this project, I want to explore the the proportion of Asians in the major tech companies. </p>

<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>I will be referring to EEO1 Diversity reports relesed by major tech companies over the years. These reports are not relesed by all tech companies. So, my analysis would be based on the companies who release the report.</p>

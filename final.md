<h1>Final Presentation </h1>
<p>My topic evolved a lot thoughout the course. I started with the intention of covering the state of Asians in the tech industry. On resaerching about the topic, I stumbled across multiple refrences to the model minority stereotype. The more I read the more I realised that the topic falls under the umbrella of the model minority stereotype. So I decided to make my presentation on the broader model minority topic.</p>
<p>I made some chages from my wireframes that I submitted for part 2. I ommited some elemens that did not fit into the story.</p>
<p>I narrowed down the stereotype from 3 to 2. The 3rd stereotype was Asians do well acdemically. It was similar to my first stereotype that Asians are good at math. It did not add any value to the presentation and not much data was avalable on it.</p>
<p>I also removed data abot covid crimes against Asians as it was a new topic altogether and squeezing it in this presentation would have made it longer. It could have taken the focus away from the model minority topic to covid.</p>
<p>I kept the text minimal so that the sentences makes an impact.</p>
<p>I used the color purple throughout the presentation to highlight main points or words that I wanted to highlight. I stuck to my clor scheme of gray and purple.</p>
<p>The presentation is as follows:</p>

Hello this is me, Alisha. Here you'd find my attempts at vizualizing data!

# About me
I'm a student at Carnegie mellon University who loves to read, write, draw, cook. Lately I've been tring to understand digital design experinces. In the winter break, I learnt how to draw digitally. I also learnt about colors - the way colors are digitised and shared. I've been intrested in color palletes and after a few months of expolring, I have settled on a color scheme for my own personal art projects. And that color scheme is a spectrum of blue/aqua tones. 

So, I found the course of Telling Stories with Data at CMU and thought it fit in well with my hobby and work experience. So far it has been fun. This repository would act as a placeholder for all the projects I underatke from the learnings of the course.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn the art of restraint in vizualization. But more importantly, I want to learn the art of convincing my colleagues that a simple, minimal design works better than a cluttered, all encompassing one. I've had past experiences when I knew that a minimal design template worked the best but I lacked the vocabulary to make my point and convince them. Through this course I want to develop the ability to critique vizualizations in a manner that even the people who are indiffernt to design understand.

WORK IN PROGRESS! All data will be here once I start building something :)

Hello this is me, Alisha. Here you'd find my attempts at vizualizing data!

# About me
I'm a student at Carnegie mellon University who loves to read, write, draw, cook. Lately I've been tring to understand digital design experinces. In the winter break, I learnt how to draw digitally. I also learnt about colors - the way colors are digitised and shared. I'm fascinated by the intersection of art, data and vizualizations. 

# What I hope to learn
Through this course, I hope to learn the art of restraint in vizualization. I want to develop the ability to critique vizualizations in a manner that even the people who are indiffernt to design understand.But more importantly, I want to create vizualization that have an impact.

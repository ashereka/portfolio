<h1>Debt-To-GDP Ratio Fluctuations</h1>
<p>This box plot shows us the relative fluctuations in GDP-to-Debt ratio and its fluctuations.</p>
<p>Some countries such as Japan and Greece stand out as they have have a bigger flucatuations than the rest. This graph makes us curious about the socio-economic situations that must have cause this. The actionable step based on this graph is to investigate those socio-economic situations.</p>
<p>I used the color yellow for the dots. I wanted to aviod red, green, blue color as they stand for either positive or negative connotations. Pink and orange are similar to red can evoke those connotations as well. I wanted to avoid that connotation so I went for the neutral yellow.</p>
<p>The reason I avoided the negative/positive connotation is that a higher vale not necessarily corresponds to good or bad performance. As economies are dynamic a one dimetional snapshot would capture the nuances and context. Even if a country like Japan has higher debt to gdp ratio, it does not imply that it is failing. That is why I felt it was important to use a neutral color.</p>
